## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

   API allows different software applications to communicate with each other by defining a set of rules. This allows for smooth interaction between various systems.

   API acts as a middleman delivering a userâ€™s request to a system and then transferring the systemâ€™s response back to the user.

   APIs significant in software development serve as bridges, allowing software applications to communicate and share information seamlessly.
   They drive innovation and enable developers to do the following:
     - Integrate different systems and services.
     - Promotes code reusability and maintainability.
     - Build upon existing platforms.
     - Enhance user experiences.


2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

   Interface â€“ it is the part that is responsible for user interaction and is the human interface to the software.

   API â€“ entirely comprises more than just the user interface but with embedded processes and programs that perform tasks that are not exposed on the user interface.


3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

   Main components of API

   Endpoint â€“ It is a specific URL where an API can access the information it needs.

   Request â€“ It is the message sent by the client to the API, to perform a certain action or ask for specific information. 

    A request includes:
     - HTTP Method: like GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE
     - Adding necessary HTTP headers.
     - Parameters â€“ to provide specific details about what the client is requesting.
     - HTTP response status code â€“ to quickly identify communication issues between client and server applications.

   Authentication â€“ to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify the data.

   Types of APIs
    - Web APIs
    - Restful APIs
    - SOAP APIs
    - GraphQL APIs

   I find Web API interesting because of its ability to enhance functionality by leveraging on existing functionalities provided by other services without having to build them from scratch. These help to reduce development time and cost.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

   Yes, I have used thinkspeak to post data before the API learning in this course.

   Where I used ThinkSpeak API and temperature sensor to plot a live reading of the sensor in a graphical method on the ThinkSpeak platform.

   Also, I used the telegram library and token to send alerts from my program to the telegram application.

   With the API exploration tools still need to practice to comprehend them better.


5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

   I am confident in the Web APIs, they are easy to implement and enhance user experience.

   I have to improve on tools for API exploration and Testing like Postman so I can be able to use them to rest and debug APIs during development.

   Steps to take are to learn Postman on YouTube, and Udemy courses and also ask my colleagues to give a dry run into Postman as it is used at my workplace.
